    End goal - big picture, before freshman register for classes. Coursicle but better
        Better UI/UX than couricel. Make it simple and specfic to UNC Students
        Fast and clean.
        
    How It Works
        - Students input class name they want and preffered time
        - We create a database of all calsses offered at unc along with the rmp score
        - Automatically generate several class schedules 
        - Combine course planner with schedule generator


    What We Will Use
        Git
        Typescript
        Sequal Database
        MongoDB
        API: Javascript - Node.js, django, flask, or fast api
        Figma
