    End goal - big picture, before freshman register for classes. Coursicle but better
        Better UI/UX than couricel. Make it simple and specfic to UNC Students
        Fast and clean.
        
    How It Works
        - Students input class name they want and preffered time
        - We create a database of all calsses offered at unc along with the rmp score
        - Automatically generate several class schedules 
        - Combine course planner with schedule generator


    What We Will Use
        Git
        Typescript
        Sequal Database
        MongoDB
        API: Javascript - Node.js, django, flask, or fast api

    Juan - Back end
    Gio - Front End

    By Monday April 7th have a minimum viable product, that contains basic UI.

April 7, 2025.
    Work together to impliment the api for the goal of linking front and back end
    Just act like a user

    Just taking data from the front end and sending it to back end then displaying it back on back end.

    Both study up on fast api and network protocols and fastapi documentation

    Juan
        Find tools to build the api
    Gio
        Add button to generate schedule, button sends all the data to backend
        Figma: Develop better layout
